begun when I searched for a way to visualise battles in my\n              D&D campaign.\n              <br />\n              The first approach was to use a physical map, which was nearly\n              impossible for the huge maps that are often used in campaign\n              books. The printout would be more than 2 meters in length.\n              <br />\n              The next thing we tried was to use a tablet with a pen. This works\n              quite smoothly because it has a similar usability than the pencil\n              drawn maps of my youth, but it was quite challenging to move the\n              tokens around. Every token has to be erased and drawn again in a\n              other location.
